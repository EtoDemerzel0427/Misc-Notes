# Hash tables

**Feature**： supports the INSERT, DELETE, and FIND operations in expected $O(1)$ time.

**Core idea**: use a *hash function* that maps a **large** keyspace to a **smaller** domain of array indices, and then use constant-time array operations to store and retrieve the data.

**Applications in data structure**:

* **Dictionary** data type(keys and values)
*  **set**(only keys, no values)



>  For the following, we use n to denote the number of keys, and m the number of slots in the hash table.

**Resolving collisions**:

1. **chaining**: each location a pointer to a linked list. (Consider the worst case for searching in this scenario) 

   **load factor** $\alpha = \dfrac{n}{m}$, average failed search: $O(\alpha$).

2. **Open addressing**: if not in right place, fix some probe sequence, e.g, $H(x), H(x) + 1, H(x)+2, ...$

   $\alpha = \dfrac{n}{m} \leq 1$, or we will run out of space. **In fact we must ensure it is strictly less than 1, or some search may never terminate.**(in this case never will an empty location be reached) In the worst case expected cost (probe number) of FIND is bounded by $\dfrac{1}{1 - \dfrac{n}{m}}$.

**Choose a hash function**:

**We want our hash function to look as close as it can to a random function**.

1. **division method**: If keys are large integers, we just compute the remainder mod m, and the m is typically chosen to be a large prime. If we want to hash strings $a_1a_2a_3...a_k$, we can represent it as $\sum_i a_ib^i$, where $b$ is a base chosen to be **larger than the number of characters**. (Typically we don't really compute such a large number, instead, we compute its remainder mode m; but note that **computing remainders is a relatively slow operation**)

   ```c
   /* treat strings as base-256 integers */
   /* with digits in the range 1 to 255 */
   #define BASE (256)
   
   size_t
   hash(const char *s, size_t m)
   {
       size_t h;
       unsigned const char *us;
   
       /* cast s to unsigned const char * */
       /* this ensures that elements of s will be treated as having values >= 0 */
       us = (unsigned const char *) s;
   
       h = 0;
       while(*us != '\0') {
           h = (h * BASE + *us) % m;
           us++;
       } 
   
       return h;
   }
   ```

   

1. **multiplication method**: Very similar to the division method discussed above, but change the base to a small prime, and the modulus m to be something like $2^{32}$（depends on how big the `size_t` is).

   ```c
   #define MULTIPLIER (37)
   
   size_t
   hash(const char *s)
   {
       size_t h;
       unsigned const char *us;
   
       /* cast s to unsigned const char * */
       /* this ensures that elements of s will be treated as having values >= 0 */
       us = (unsigned const char *) s;
   
       h = 0;
       while(*us != '\0') {
           h = h * MULTIPLIER + *us;
           us++;
       } 
   
       return h;
   }
   ```

   

2. **Universal hashing**:

   The above 2 methods are both **deterministic**, but universal hashing is different.

   You are given a family of hash functions, each time you get a new key to hash, you randomly pick one hash function from the family to do the hashing.

   The property that makes a family of hash functions {$H_r$} universal is that, **for any distinct keys $x$ and $y$, the probability that $r$ is chosen so that $H_r(x) = H_r(y)$ is exactly 1/*m*.**

   For more detailed explanation check Section 2.1 of [this](<https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/pscico-guyb/realworld/www/slidesS14/hashing.pdf>).

   The following code is an implementation for the example in the above link, which maps n-bit vector to m-bit vector.

   Note that in this case, we are mapping strings to strings, but since each string is make up of several characters, and each character can be written in ascii form as bit vectors. So here, `n = string_length * bits_per_char, m = size_t * bits_per_char`.

   ```c
   /* implements universal hashing using random bit-vectors in x */
   /* assumes number of elements in x is at least BITS_PER_CHAR * MAX_STRING_SIZE */
   
   #define BITS_PER_CHAR (8)       /* not true on all machines! */
   #define MAX_STRING_SIZE (128)   /* we'll stop hashing after this many */
   #define MAX_BITS (BITS_PER_CHAR * MAX_STRING_SIZE)
   
   size_t
   hash(const char *s, size_t x[])
   {
       size_t h;
       unsigned const char *us;
       int i;
       unsigned char c;
       int shift;
   
       /* cast s to unsigned const char * */
       /* this ensures that elements of s will be treated as having values >= 0 */
       us = (unsigned const char *) s;
   
       h = 0;
       for(i = 0; *us != 0 && i < MAX_BITS; us++) {
           c = *us;
           for(shift = 0; shift < BITS_PER_CHAR; shift++, i++) {
               /* is low bit of c set? */
               if(c & 0x1) {
                   h ^= x[i];
               }
               
               /* shift c to get new bit in lowest position */
               c >>= 1;
           }
       }
   
       return h;
   }
   ```
